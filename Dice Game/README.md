DICE GAME

It is a multiplayer game
Each player will get a turn, and will roll the dice
The player is going to get some number from 1 to 6
If the player get any number other than 1, he will add that number to the score of his turn
He gets another turn and he will add all the scores
He can decide when to stop rolling dice and how many times he can roll the dice
Now the catch is as soon as the player hits a 1, whatever he scores till that turn will be set to 0
With every additional turn, the player is gambling the possibility of loosing his score
When he stops roling, whatever his score is, assuming it is not 0 will be added to the total score
Whoever reaches the maximum score which is determined before the start of the game, is the winner of the game 

Good luck!
